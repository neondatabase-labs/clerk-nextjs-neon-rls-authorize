# Neon RLS + Clerk Example (SQL from the Backend)

A quick start Next.js template demonstrating secure user authentication and authorization using Neon RLS with Clerk integration. This guide primarily uses SQL from the backend to enforce row-level security policies.

## Features

- Next.js application with TypeScript
- User authentication powered by Clerk
- Row-level security using Neon RLS
- Database migrations with Drizzle ORM
- Ready-to-deploy configuration for Vercel, Netlify, and Render

## Prerequisites

- [Neon](https://neon.tech) account with a new project
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com) account with a new application
- Node.js 18+ installed locally

## One-Click Deploy

Deploy directly to your preferred hosting platform:

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/clerk-nextjs-neon-rls)

## Local Development Setup

### Configure Clerk

1. Navigate to your Clerk dashboard and create a new application.
2. Obtain your **Publishable key** and **Secret key** from the Clerk dashboard.

3. In your Clerk dashboard, go to **JWT Templates**.

4. Create a new JWT Template (select "Blank" as the template type).
    ![Clerk JWT New Template Select](/images/clerk-jwt-new-template-select.png)
5. Name your template (e.g., `neon_rls`).
6. Copy the **JWKS Endpoint** URL. You'll need this for Neon RLS.

### Set Up Neon RLS

1. Open your Neon Console and click on **RLS** in your project's settings.
2. Click **Add Authentication Provider**.
3. Paste the **JWKS Endpoint** URL you copied from Clerk into the **JWKS URL** field.
4. Follow the steps in the Neon UI to set up the `authenticated` role. You can skip the schema-related steps if you are just getting started with this example.

4. Follow the steps in the UI to setup the roles for Neon RLS. You should ignore the schema related steps if you're following this guide.
5. Note down the connection strings for both the **`neondb_owner` role** and the **`authenticated, passwordless` role**. You'll need both. The `neondb_owner` role has full privileges and is used for migrations, while the `authenticated` role will be used by the application and will have its access restricted by RLS.

### Local Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/clerk-nextjs-neon-rls
    cd clerk-nextjs-neon-rls
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install  # or bun install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and fill the following environment variables:

    ```bash
    cp .env.template .env
    ```

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=YOUR_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_CLERK_SECRET_KEY

    # For the `neondb_owner` role.
    DATABASE_URL="YOUR_NEON_OWNER_CONNECTION_STRING"
    # For the `authenticated`, passwordless role.
    DATABASE_AUTHENTICATED_URL="YOUR_NEON_AUTHENTICATED_CONNECTION_STRING"

    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
    ```

    > **Note:** Replace the placeholder values with your actual Neon and Clerk credentials.

4. Run the database migrations:

    ```bash
    npm run drizzle:generate  # or bun run drizzle:generate
    npm run drizzle:migrate  # or bun run drizzle:migrate
    ```

5. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev  # or bun run dev
    ```

6. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application running

## Important: Production Setup

Before deploying to production:

1. Modify your Clerk application environment to use the Production instance. Create one if you haven't already.
    ![Clerk Production Environment](/images/clerk-production-environment.png)
2. Update your environment variables with the new production credentials
3. Update your authentication configuration in Neon RLS with the new JWKS URL
